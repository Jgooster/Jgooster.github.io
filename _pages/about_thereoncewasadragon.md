My vision for this book is to inspire young ones to a sadly forgotten love for chivalrous ideals. I want to light a fire for courage, honor, readiness to help the weak, and a willingness for self-sacrifice.

I wrote this story intending to share it with my kids one day, but as I was writing, I realized this could be a timeless tale for years to come.

Here is a story of Good versus Evil. A dragon whose pride turns dark, and a knight among knights, who rises up to protect.

Written in poetic, Dr. Seuss inspired language.
